# Simple-Notes-API
Overview Develop a RESTful API for a simple note-taking application using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database. The API should allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete text notes.

MongoDB Setup:<br>
Use MongoDB to store notes. Each note should have a title, content, and timestamps for creation and
last modification.<br>
API Endpoints:<br>
• Create Note: Endpoint to add a new note to the database.<br>
• Retrieve Notes: Endpoint to get a list of all notes, with an option to retrieve a single note by its
ID.<br>
• Update Note: Endpoint to update the content of an existing note.<br>
• Delete Note: Endpoint to delete a note from the database.<br>
Data Validation:<br>
• Implement validation for note creation and updating. Ensure that the title and content fields are
provided and are of appropriate lengths.<br>
Error Handling:<br>
• Develop comprehensive error handling for the API, covering scenarios like invalid input, trying to
access or modify non-existent notes, etc.<br>
Basic Authentication (Optional):<br>
• If time permits, add a simple authentication mechanism (like Basic Auth) to protect the
endpoints.<br>
Documentation:<br>
• Document the API endpoints, including details about request methods, URL paths, expected
request body format, and response formats.<br>
Testing:<br>
• Write basic tests to ensure API endpoints are functioning as expected.<br>
